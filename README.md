# Event System
The Dynamic Event System is an advanced event system.

## How to use Event System (ES)
- First you must create a new instance of the EventManager, this is the central point of our event system.
- Next you must create an event listener, for this you simply create a class and implement EventListener.
- Next we can create our first event therefore simply create a class which extends the Event class.
- Now we can go back to our event listener and a method which listens to the events. (To see the stucture go to the class 'src/example/EventListenerImplementation.java')
- The next step is to register the event listener to the event manager.
- Finally we can call the event.

An example can be found in the folder 'src/example'
